We need the questions to be restructured. When deligated, they are cagorized as unanswered and stay at the top. Once answered, they are closed/locked. A question can then be reopened by a user. This then puts a link to the old question and a 'RE: [old title]' in the new question. It acts then like a new question since it is. The  

-- SYSTEM --
  - ROUTING -
    Ln1 & Ln5: We need urls for all responses/questions, which means the introduction of react-router.

  - AUTHENTICATION -
    Ln2: Hook up authentication through Okta, but try to keep it as modular as possible 
    Ln3: We need an automated way for allowing access of new users. Based off of azure AD/Graph or perhaps workday?
    Extra: Create a .env file which has all the info on who the Coffee House owner is, acceptable login info, database info, and data on delegating.

  - AWS -
    Ln4: I dont see why this would be an issue. Why would there be anything in AWS dependent on up-to-date employee lists? Authentication and azure AD should handle everything for us.
    Ln15: Need to structure the question data to include an array of responders.

-- FRONT-END --
  Ln1 & Ln5: We need a share button added to each question. An ellipsis icon will be helpful as we can put the subscribe button from Ln6.
  Ln2: Add in a login button along with the avatar pic.
  Ln6: Add a subscribe button in the ellipses menu
  Ln7 & Ln8: Add the ability to filter the questions/responses by title.
  Ln10: The default sort needs to be on ranking. In open questions the highest ranked question goes on top. 
  Ln14: change the buttons to be more of a reopen-question button or ask follow-up
  Ln15 & Ln16: Change the owner text to be "Respond & Delegate" or "Respond"

  - CREATE QUESTION PAGE -
    Ln9: Use the filtering system to search all questions by title when typing in a new title. They should appear on the side as a list and when clicked on create a modal just like the expansion panel that they can directly interact with.
    Get this built, Formik may be overkill but I will look into it.

  Extra: Add all Tooltips, add in real functionality on all buttons.
